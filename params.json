All entities in GAZ can be treated as instances of environments (see the [ENVO repository](https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo)). \r\n\r\n## Downloading GAZ\r\nDue to GAZ's large size, the OWL- and OBO-formatted files will not be hosted here for the moment. You can, however, download them here:\r\n* [GAZ in OWL format](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/gaz.owl) ca. 600 MB\r\n* [GAZ in OBO format](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/gaz.obo) ca. 180 MB\r\n\r\n## Issues, comments, and questions \r\nPlease use the GAZ repository's [issue tracker](https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/gaz/issues) to post issues (such as new term requests), comments, and questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
