# GAZ
An open source gazetteer constructed on ontological principles.
PI: Michael Ashburner

## Brief description
GAZ is a large, ontologically-oriented resource listing place names which can be treated as instances of environments (see [ENVO](https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/)). 

## Getting GAZ
Due to size constraints, GAZ's OWL- and OBO-formatted files will not be hosted here for the moment. You can, however, download them here:
* [GAZ in OWL format](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/gaz.owl) ca. 600 MB
* [GAZ in OBO format](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/gaz.obo) ca. 180 MB
